# RealTimeMLB
Real Time MLB game virtual reality visualization built on the [g3n]("https://github.com/g3n/engine") 3D Engine<br>

## Goal

To be able to scrape real time baseball data and use it to fuel a physics engine <br>
so that it is like you are watching the game in virtual reality. <br>

## Current Sprint

Creating a baseball, and getting it to fly around in a physics simulation <br>
