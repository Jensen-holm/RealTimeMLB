# RealTimeMLB
Real Time MLB game virtual reality visualization built on the g3n 3D Engine (https://github.com/g3n/engine)<br>
and a wrapper package that I built for it and am still developing (https://github.com/Jensen-holm/g3n-Wrapper/tree/main/apper)<br>

## Goal

To be able to scrape real time baseball data and use it to fuel a physics engine <br>
so that it is like you are watching the game in virtual reality. <br>
